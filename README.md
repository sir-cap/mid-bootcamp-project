HYPOTESIS: Could unpopular Spotify songs become TikTok songs? 

Datasets used (from kaggle):
[Tiktok popular songs 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveta151/tiktok-popular-songs-2022) || 
[Unpopular songs Spotify](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/estienneggx/spotify-unpopular-songs)

This project was made to test the hypothesis if unpopular Spotify songs could become TikTok songs. For that purpose I used a Tiktok popular songs dataset (2022,2021,2020,2019) and a unpopular spotify songs dataset updated on August 2022.
During the process I perfomed some Featrure Extraction, Logistic Regression model and KNN model. 
I also applied a hypotesis testing using both datasets (used t-test). The result of the study are not statistically significant and there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  This means that the results of the study are not reliable and may have been obtained due to chance.
